# LS-AIR
LSAIR is an existing relational database which contains data about airports, flights, airplanes, passengers... 

This project is made up of 2 requirements. The first part is about updating a relational database and the second about design and implement graph database.

LSAIR relational database is divided in 4 modules. The first one is about flights, the second about airports, the third about shopping and the last one about luggage. There's an extra module that is a cross-module, in which we can use all tables of the database.

LSAIR graph database is divided en 2 different case studies. The first one is about airplane, airport, city and country and the second is about pilots, flight attendee, language, flight and airport.

Concepts developed in this project:

- Update LSAIR relational database by implementing: new queries, tables, triggers and events.

- Design and implement a LSAIR graph-based database with data from LSAIR relational database.

- Provide documentation that describes the whole project: physical model updates, triggers/events, queries, graph model, and queries on graph-based database.
